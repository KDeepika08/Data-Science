Q1)Explain foll with example:
1)Artificial Intelligence:
  AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, 
  problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.Artificial intelligence involves replicating human intellectual processes through machines, especially computers.
  Eg:One example of AI is image recognition, which involves training a machine to recognize objects, patterns, or features in images.
  
2)Machine learning:
  Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data. 
  Eg:Spam filtering in email.
  In this scenario, a machine learning algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) and uses this information to predict whether new, unseen 
  emails are spam or not. The algorithm learns patterns and features in the text of the emails that are associated with spam, such as certain keywords or phrases,
  and uses this information to make predictions.
  
3)Deep learning:
  Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns in data. Deep learning algorithms are 
  inspired by the structure of the human brain.
  Eg:Image recognition where a deep learning algorithm such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on a large dataset of labeled images. 
  The algorithm learns to identify patterns and features in the images at different levels of abstraction, such as edges, textures, shapes, and objects.
